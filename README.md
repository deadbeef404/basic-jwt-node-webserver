### This is a server

For the client side, here's a boilerplate project using React and Redux: https://github.com/deadbeef404/redux-auth-client/

### Credits 

This was created as part of an excellent Udemy course named "Advanced React and Redux" by Stephen Grider.

I have done three courses created by him on Udemy and cannot recommend them enough. They are awesome.
